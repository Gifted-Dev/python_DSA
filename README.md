# Data Structure and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my learning of Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. I would also share common algorithms in DSA that I find and solutions to DSA related problems from platforms like Leetcode, HackerRank and CodeWars.

## Repository Structure
- data structures: Implementation of various data structures
- algorithms: Common algorithms includingi sorting, searching etc.
- problems: solutions to DSA related problems from different platforms.

## Progress
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Graphs
